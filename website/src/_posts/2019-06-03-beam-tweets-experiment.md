At Apache Beam we are trying out a new experiment to bring the Beam community into the social 
media presence of the project. Our goal is to help the community share news and have a good point 
of contact to know of the goings-on in Beam; as well as giving exposure to contributors that do interesting 
things in all areas of the project.

With this goal in mind, we are trying the following approach:

- If you have something you would like to share, please go to [s.apache.org/beam-tweets](http://s.apache.org/beam-tweets), and add it.
- The tweets proposed in the spreadsheet will be reviewed by members of the Apache Beam PMC, and if approved they will be tweeted (or retweeted if you want a retweet).
- Add your contact information if you want reviewers to be able to reach you with questions

Initially this will be an experimental approach, to see if the community finds this useful - and if the engagement in the @ApacheBeam twitter improves, we will improve, and formalize this process.

We are excited to see how this experiment plays out! : )
